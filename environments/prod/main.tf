# This is the main configuration for the prod environment.
# It will only contain comments related to resource creation and management.
# to create a new resource in this environment, create a new subfolder named <resource type>-resources>
# and add a new file named <resource name>.tf in that folder.
# For example, to create a new S3 bucket for the app named wordpress, create a new file named wordpress-bucket in the s3-resources directory.
